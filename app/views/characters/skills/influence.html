                There are several ways to influence others;
                each is a separate influence skill. A successful
                roll will result in a good reaction
                from an NPC. Failure results in a bad
                reaction (except for Diplomacy, which is
                relatively safe). To actually coerce or manipulate
                an NPC, you must win a Quick
                Contest of your skill versus his Will.
                Methods of influencing others include:
