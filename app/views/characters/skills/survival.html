                This is the ability to “live off the land,”
                find safe food and water, avoid hazards,
                build shelter, etc. To live safely in a wilderness
                situation, you must make a successful
                Survival roll once per day. Failure inflicts
                2d-4 injury on you and anyone in your care.
                There are many different types of Survival
                skill, which must be learned independently
