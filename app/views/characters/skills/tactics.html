                This is the ability to outguess and outmaneuver
                the enemy in small-unit or personal
                combat.

            <p>
                When commanding a small unit, roll
                against Tactics to place your troops correctly
                for an ambush, know where to post sentries,
                etc. In personal combat, you may
                make a Tactics roll before the fight begins if
                you had any time to prepare. On a success,
                you start the fight in an advantageous position
                – e.g., behind cover or on higher
                ground – as determined by the GM.
