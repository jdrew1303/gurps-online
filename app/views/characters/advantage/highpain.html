                You are as susceptible to injury as anyone
                else, but you don’t feel it as much. You
                never suffer a shock penalty when you are
                injured. In addition, you get +3 on all HT
                rolls to avoid knockdown and stunning –
                and if you are tortured physically, you get
                +3 to resist. The GM may let you roll at
                Will+3 to ignore pain in other situations.
