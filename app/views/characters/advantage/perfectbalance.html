                You can always keep your footing, no
                matter how narrow the walking surface
                (tightrope, ledge, tree limb, etc.), under
                normal conditions without having to make
                a die roll. If the surface is wet, slippery, or
                unstable, you get +6 on all rolls to keep your
                feet. In combat, you get +4 to DX and DXbased
                skill rolls to keep your feet or avoid
                being knocked down. Finally, you get +1 to
                Acrobatics and Climbing skill.
