                You have a “feeling” for people.
                When you first meet someone – or are
                reunited after an absence – you may ask the
                GM to roll against your IQ. He will tell you
                what you “feel” about that person. On a
                failed IQ roll, he will lie!
                This talent is excellent for spotting
                imposters, possession, etc., and for
                determining the true loyalties of NPCs.
