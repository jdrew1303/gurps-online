                You are incredibly difficult to kill. Each
                level of Hard to Kill gives +1 to HT rolls
                made for survival at -HP or below, and on
                any HT roll where failure means instant
                death (due to heart failure, poison, etc.). If
                this bonus makes the difference between
                success and failure, you collapse, apparently
                dead (or disabled), but come to in the
                usual amount of time â€“ see Recovering from
                Unconsciousness (p. 30).
