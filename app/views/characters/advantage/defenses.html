                You are unusually adept at evading
                attacks! This may be due to careful observation
                of your foe, focusing chi, or anything
                else that fits your background. There are
                three versions:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Enhanced Block:</b> You have +1 to your
                Block score with Shield skill. 5 points.
            <p>
                <b>Enhanced Dodge:</b> You have +1 to your
                Dodge score. 15 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Enhanced Parry:</b> You have +1 to your
                Parry score. You may take this advantage
                for bare hands (5 points), for any one Melee
                Weapon skill (5 points), or for all parries (10
                points). 5 or 10 points.
