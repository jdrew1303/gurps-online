                You are unusually talented at reading
                the motivations of animals. When you meet
                an animal, the GM rolls against your IQ and
                tells you what you “feel.” This reveals the
                beast’s emotional state – friendly, frightened,
                hostile, hungry, etc. – and whether it
                is under supernatural control. You may also
                use your Influence skills (see p. 15) on animals
                just as you would on sapient beings,
                which usually ensures a positive reaction.
