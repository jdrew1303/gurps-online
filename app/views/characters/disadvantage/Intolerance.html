                You dislike and distrust some (or all)
                people who are different from you. You
                may be prejudiced on the basis of class,
                ethnicity, nationality, religion, sex, or
                species. Victims of your Intolerance will
                react to you at -1 to -5 (GMâ€™s decision).
                Point value depends on the scope of your
                Intolerance
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are thoroughly intolerant, you
                react at -3 toward anyone not of your own
                class, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or
                species (pick one). Total Intolerance of this
                kind is worth -10 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Intolerance directed at only one specific
                class, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sex, or
                species is worth from -5 points for a commonly
                encountered victim to -1 point (a
                nasty quirk) for a rare victim.
