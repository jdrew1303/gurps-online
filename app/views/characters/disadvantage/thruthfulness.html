                You hate to tell a lie â€“ or you are just very
                bad at it. Make a self-control roll whenever
                you must keep silent about an uncomfortable
                truth (lying by omission). Roll at -5 if
                you actually have to tell a falsehood! If you
                fail, you blurt out the truth, or stumble so
                much that your lie is obvious. You have a
                permanent -5 to Fast-Talk skill, and your
                Acting skill is at -5 when your purpose is to
                deceive.
