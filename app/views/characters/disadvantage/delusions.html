                You believe something that simply is not
                true. This may cause others to consider you
                insane. And they may be right! If you suffer
                from a Delusion, you must roleplay your
                belief at all times. The point value of the
                Delusion depends on its nature.

            <p>
                <b>A Minor Delusion</b> affects your behavior,
                and anyone around you will soon notice it
                (and react at -1), but it does not keep you
                from functioning more-or-less normally. -5
                points.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>A Major Delusion</b> strongly affects your
                behavior, but does not keep you from living
                a fairly normal life. Others will react to you
                at -2. -10 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>A Severe Delusion</b> affects your behavior
                so much that it may keep you from functioning
                in the everyday world. Others react
                to you at -3, but they are more likely to fear
                or pity you than to attack. -15 points.
