                You want to see your foes
                dead. In battle, you must go for killing blows, and
                put in an extra shot to make sure of a
                downed foe. You must make a self-control
                roll whenever you need to accept a surrender,
                evade a sentry, take a prisoner, etc. If
                you fail, you attempt to kill your foe instead
                â€“ even if that means breaking the law, compromising
                stealth, wasting ammo, or violating
                orders. Out of combat, you never forget
                that a foe is a foe.
