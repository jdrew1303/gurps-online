                You are opposed to violence. This can
                take two forms.

                <b>Reluctant Killer:</b> You get -4 to hit a person
                (not a monster, machine, etc.) with a deadly
                attack, or -2 if you can’t see his face. If you
                kill someone, roll 3d – you’re morose and
                useless for that many days. -5 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Cannot Harm Innocents:</b> You may fight –
                you may even start fights – but you may only
                use deadly force on a foe that is attempting
                to do you serious harm. -10 points.
