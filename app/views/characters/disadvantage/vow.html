                You have sworn an oath to do (or not to
                do) something. Whatever the oath, you take it
                seriously; if you didnâ€™t, it would not be a disadvantage.
                This trait is especially appropriate
                for knights, holy men, and fanatics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point value of a Vow should be directly
                related to the inconvenience it causes you.
                The GM is the final judge. Some examples:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Minor Vow:</b> Silence during daylight hours;
                vegetarianism; chastity (yes, for game purposes,
                this is minor). -5 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Major Vow:</b> Use no edged weapons; keep
                silence at all times; never sleep indoors; own
                no more than your horse can carry. -10
                points.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Great Vow:</b> Never refuse any request for
                aid; always fight with the wrong hand; hunt
                a given foe until you destroy him; challenge
                every knight you meet to combat. -15 points.
            </p>
