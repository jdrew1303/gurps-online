                You hate talk and debate. You prefer
                action! When you are alone, you act first
                and think later. In a group, when your
                friends want to stop and discuss something,
                you should put in your two cents’ worth
                quickly – if at all – and then do something.
                Roleplay it! Make a self-control roll whenever
                it would be wise to wait and ponder. If
                you fail, you must act.
