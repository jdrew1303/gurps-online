                Strength measures physical power and bulk.
                It is crucial if you are a warrior in a primitive world, as high ST lets you dish out and absorb more damage in hand-to-hand combat.
                Any adventurer will find ST useful for lifting and throwing things, moving quickly with a load, etc.

            <p>
                Strength is more “open-ended” than other attributes; scores greater than 20 are common among beings such as large animals, fantasy monsters, and robots.
