            <h3>-5 points/level</h3>
            <p>
                You have a natural ability to impress and lead others.
                Anyone can acquire a semblance of charisma through looks, manners, and intelligence â€“ but real charisma is independent of these things.
                Each level gives +1 on all reaction rolls made by sapient beings with whom you actively interact (converse, lecture, etc.);
                +1 to Influence rolls (see Influence Rolls, p. 24);
                and +1 to Leadership and Public Speaking skills.
                The GM may rule that your Charisma does not affect members of extremely alien races.
