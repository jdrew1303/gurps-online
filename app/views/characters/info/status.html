                Status is a measure of social standing. In
                most game worlds, Status levels range from
                -2 (serf or street person) to 8 (powerful
                emperor or god-king), with the average
                man being Status 0 (freeman or ordinary
                citizen). If you do not specifically buy
                Status, you have Status 0. Status costs 5
                points per level. For instance, Status 5 costs
                25 points, while Status -2 is -10 points.

            <p>
                Status greater than 0 means you are a
                member of the ruling class in your culture.
                As a result, others in your culture only defer
                to you, giving you a bonus on all reaction
                rolls. Status less than 0 means you are a serf
                or a slave, or simply very poor.
