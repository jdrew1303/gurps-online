                It is possible to be so well-known that your reputation becomes an advantage or a disadvantage.
                This affects reaction rolls made by NPCs (see p. 3).
            </p>
            <p>
                The details of your reputation are entirely up to you;
                you can be known for bravery, ferocity, eating green snakes, or whatever you want.
                However, you must give specifics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specify the reaction-roll modifier that you get from people who recognize you.
                This determines the base cost of your reputation.
                For every +1 bonus to reaction rolls (up to +4), the cost is 5 points.
                For every -1 penalty (up to -4), the cost is -5 points.
