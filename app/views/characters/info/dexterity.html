                Dexterity measures a combination of agility, coordination, and fine motor ability.
                It controls your basic ability at most athletic, fighting, and vehicle-operation skills,
                and at craft skills that call for a delicate touch.
                DX also helps determine Basic Speed (a measure of reaction time, p. 6) and Basic Move (how fast you run, p. 6).
