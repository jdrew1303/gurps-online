                Intelligence broadly measures brainpower, including creativity, intuition, memory, perception, reason, sanity, and willpower.
                It rules your basic ability with all “mental” skills – sciences, social interaction, magic, etc.
                Any wizard, scientist, or gadgeteer needs a high IQ first of all.
                The secondary characteristics of Will (p. 6) and Perception (p. 6) are based on IQ.
