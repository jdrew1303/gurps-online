                You usually or always behave in a fashion
                repugnant to others. An Odious
                Personal Habit (OPH) is worth -5 points for
                every -1 to reaction rolls made by people
                who notice your problem. Specify the
                behavior when you create your character,
                and work out the point value with the GM.
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples: Body odor, constant scratching,
                or tuneless humming would give -1 to
                reactions, and are worth -5 points apiece.
                Constant bad puns or spitting on the floor
                would give -2 to reactions, worth -10 points
                apiece. We leave -15-point habits (-3 to reactions)
                to the imagination of those depraved
                enough to want them!
